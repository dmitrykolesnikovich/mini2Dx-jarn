# jarn
Java-based interpreter for Yarn

##Â About

Jarn (or Yarn - [I think it might be a soft j](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OQ4wmqt7po)) is a Java-based interpreter for the [Yarn](https://github.com/infiniteammoinc/Yarn) language.

However, it uses ANTLR to generate the parser so it would be possible to create interpreters in other languages in the future.
