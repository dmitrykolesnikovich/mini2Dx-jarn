About
--------------------------

Jarn (or Yarn - [I think it might be a soft j](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OQ4wmqt7po)) is a Java-based interpreter for the [Yarn](https://github.com/infiniteammoinc/Yarn) language.

However, it uses ANTLR to generate the parser so it would be possible to create interpreters in other languages in the future.

Usage
--------------------------
See the [wiki](https://github.com/mini2Dx/jarn/wiki) for documentation.
